## 👥 Roles & Permissions

There are **three roles** with different capabilities:

| Role                | Permissions                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Admin**           | 🔹 Full control: create projects, assign team members, assign managers, see analytics, all tasks/projects    |
| **Project Manager** | 🔹 Manage only their projects. Can create and delete any task within their projects.                         |
| **User**            | 🔹 View projects they’re part of. Can create tasks (assigned to themselves) and delete only their own tasks. |

- When a user is assigned as a manager to a project, their role is automatically promoted to **Project Manager**.
- Analytics and notifications are currently accessible only to **Admin**.
